On October 7th, 2021, I reached an important milestone in my academic journey—my graduation day at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/), where I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering. The day was bittersweet, as it marked the end of an intense and enriching chapter of my life. Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, the ceremony felt special, and I am proud to share that I graduated with a **110/110 cum laude grade**.

It was an unusual time to graduate—still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions—but the experience and the emotions tied to it are unforgettable. The global crisis made the process even more meaningful, as I learned to adapt to virtual environments, digital interactions, and to continue pushing myself in these tough times.

I owe a huge part of this success to my thesis work, which was both challenging and incredibly rewarding. The thesis, titled [Teaching a Learner Driver using Reinforcement Learning and Planning Strategies](https://angelicasofia.github.io/projects/17_project/), was a deep dive into the fascinating world of autonomous driving. Specifically, I studied the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in autonomous vehicles, focusing on Teacher-Student RL approaches and planning algorithms. The project aimed to develop expert trajectories for self-driving cars—a topic of critical importance in the autonomous driving and racing car fields.

I must extend my deepest gratitude to my Supervisor, Associate Professor [Marcello Restelli](https://restelli.faculty.polimi.it/MyWebSite/index.shtml), and Co-Supervisor, Alessandro Lavelli, who provided guidance, expertise, and unwavering support throughout the process. Their mentorship was key in navigating the complexities of my research, and their feedback helped me refine and enhance my work. The insights gained during this journey have opened up exciting opportunities for future developments in the field.

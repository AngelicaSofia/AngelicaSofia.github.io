The first of three Graduation Day ceremonies took place the 4th of October 2022 at Allianz Cloud in Milan, celebrating graduates of the Politecnico di Milano who completed their degrees during the Covid-19 emergency period. The event, described by the university as an official moment of celebration to be shared with family and friends, honored a significant academic achievement.

Over 680 graduates attended the opening evening, welcomed by Rector Ferruccio Resta and Enrico Zio, Delegate for Alumni and Individual Fundraising. The evening featured a keynote lecture by Elisa Pagliarani, General Manager of Glovo Italy and an alumna of the university.

Strongly supported by Rector Resta, the event also included video messages from distinguished alumni—leaders in architecture, design, and engineering—who offered words of encouragement to the new graduates. Notable contributors included Renzo Piano, Mauro Porcini (PepsiCo), Maria Grazia Vittadini (Rolls-Royce), Piero Lissoni, Renato Mazzoncini (A2A), Francesco Starace (Enel), Giampaolo Dallara, and Nicola Monti (Edison).

The celebration continued on October 5 and 6, with a total of 3,186 graduates and 5,540 guests.

I'm proud to share that I was selected among 20 distinguished Alumni to be personally awarded by Rector Ferruccio Resta during the Graduation Day 2023 ceremony at Allianz Cloud. I earned my degree on October 7th, 2021 in Computer Science and Engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, graduating with full marks (110/110 cum laude). My thesis, developed in collaboration with the automotive industry, focused on optimizing controller trajectories on the Formula 1 track at the Monza Autodrome.

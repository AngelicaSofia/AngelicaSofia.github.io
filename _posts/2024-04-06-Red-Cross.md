## 160th Anniversary of Italian Red Cross

On the occasion of the Vatican audience, 6,000 volunteers from across Italy gathered to meet Pope Francis, representing the over 150,000 members of the [Italian Red Cross](https://cri.it/2024/04/06/croce-rossa-da-papa-francesco-con-6-mila-volontari-valastro-la-nostra-e-unumanita-diffusa-a-favore-delle-persone-vulnerabili/) who dedicate themselves daily to alleviating suffering and supporting vulnerable populations. President Rosario Valastro highlighted the organization’s commitment to human dignity, emphasizing the seven principles of the Red Cross and the importance of humanity in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. He discussed the challenges faced by the Red Cross, including poverty, migration, loneliness, and humanitarian crises, while stressing their preparedness for future challenges. The event also featured testimonies from volunteers on their efforts during recent emergencies, such as the pandemic, the Emilia Romagna flood, the migrant crisis in Lampedusa, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Gaza. A moment of silence was observed for the victims of COVID-19 and those who lost their lives during the pandemic. Additionally, Valastro honored the victims of the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake and thanked volunteers for their dedication in such tragic circumstances. The audience was attended by various Red Cross leaders, as well as government officials, underscoring the deep commitment to humanitarian work and solidarity.

On Sunday, 29 September 2024, the historic city of Cremona hosted the **[third edition of PolimiRide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebFlyn60X1s)**, the much-anticipated non-competitive cycling event organized by the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it). Once again, the ride united students, alumni, university staff, and citizens of all ages in a spirited and inclusive celebration of sport, nature, and community.

This year’s edition marked a significant milestone, drawing over 1,200 participants from across the region and beyond. The event’s purpose extended beyond cycling: it was a moment of collective movement, environmental awareness, and proud representation of the values that Politecnico di Milano continues to uphold—sustainability, innovation, and social connection.

Both routes started and concluded at Via del Sale, just outside Parco Colonie Padane, where the PolimiRide Village was set up with food stalls, relaxation areas, sponsor booths, and live entertainment. Participants began gathering from 8:30 AM, welcomed by volunteers, music, and warm-up activities. The official start signal rang out at 10:30 AM, unleashing waves of cyclists dressed in the official adidas jersey, each bearing their race bib and tracking chip.

Throughout the course, riders were supported by multiple refreshment points, mechanical service stations, and medical assistance, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all. Upon returning, everyone was invited to a lively **Pasta Party**, turning the finish line into a place of festivity and shared achievement.

Beyond the physical activity, [PolimiRide](https://www.sport.polimi.it/en/events/polimiride) embodied the spirit of the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it): a dynamic, engaged, and conscious community. The event reflected the university’s strong focus on sustainability, inclusion, and well-being. It reinforced a message that resonates within and beyond academia—that movement and connection can bring people together, inspire healthy lifestyles, and foster civic responsibility.


## Cremona: A City of Music, Art, and Timeless Craftsmanship

Cremona, in the heart of Lombardy, is a city where history and artistry come together in perfect harmony. World-renowned as the cradle of violin-making, it was home to master luthiers like **[Antonio Stradivari](https://www.casastradivari.org/en)**, whose legacy lives on in the city’s internationally acclaimed violin workshops and museums. Beyond its musical fame, Cremona boasts a stunning medieval skyline dominated by the Torrazzo—one of the tallest brick bell towers in Europe—and an elegant historic center filled with Renaissance architecture, vibrant piazzas, and artisan boutiques. Whether you’re strolling along the Po River or enjoying the local cuisine in a trattoria, Cremona offers a rich, authentic Italian experience rooted in centuries of culture and creativity.

## Thales: Driving the Future of Digital Payments

At the 2023 Salone dei Pagamenti in Milan, Thales Italia showcased its commitment to digital transformation and environmental sustainability in the banking sector. The company highlighted the growing importance of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) principles in financial services, particularly through the production of eco-friendly payment cards. Globally, Thales holds a 25% market share in payment card issuance and 45% in Italy, with 50% of the cards issued in 2023 made from recycled or biodegradable materials such as ocean plastic and corn-based polymers.

Thales is also actively engaged in recycling expired cards and aims to reduce virgin plastic use entirely. With more than 40 years of presence in Italy and over 650 employees, the company continues to innovate while meeting the highest standards of security, including a strong focus on cybersecurity.

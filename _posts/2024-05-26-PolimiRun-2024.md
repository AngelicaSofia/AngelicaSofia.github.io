The race, which spans various distances, is designed to accommodate runners of all levels. From seasoned marathoners to casual joggers, the event is open to anyone with a passion for running and a desire to be part of something larger. What makes PolimiRun special is its integration into Milan’s iconic neighborhoods, offering participants the chance to run past famous landmarks, beautiful parks, and historic districts. 

Starting at the Bovisa Campus and finishing at the Leonardo Campus, the route allowed participants to cross some of Milan’s most emblematic urban areas. Runners traversed a scenic course filled with vibrant city streets, modern architecture, and moments of greenery — a physical and symbolic connection between two of the university’s main campuses.

While the run itself is undoubtedly the focal point, PolimiRun also aligns with broader goals of promoting health and fitness, sustainability, and the spirit of camaraderie within the Polimi community. As an event organized by a prestigious academic institution, it showcases the institution’s commitment not only to academic excellence but also to fostering a well-rounded, active lifestyle among its students and faculty.

The Project Management Fundamentals course is designed to provide a clear understanding of the concept of a project and demonstrate how, in the management of a successful business, projects and processes must coexist and integrate. Throughout the course, we will explore the project as a powerful managerial tool for managing change and innovation, emphasizing its essential connections to corporate strategy.

This course aligns with the approach of our Project Management academy, where, in addition to mastering planning and control techniques, a successful project manager must also possess a deep understanding of organizational dynamics. Key skills in managing both internal and external clients, as well as leading teams—particularly in high-pressure situations—are integral to the course.

Leveraging a range of experiential learning methods, this course includes practical exercises and a dedicated section on project planning and control software, ensuring you gain both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience.

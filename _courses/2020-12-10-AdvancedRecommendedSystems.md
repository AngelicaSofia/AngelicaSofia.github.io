The Advanced Recommender Systems course delved into the design and implementation of intelligent recommendation engines, moving beyond traditional collaborative and content-based filtering. The curriculum focused on hybrid recommender systems, which strategically combine multiple algorithms to overcome individual limitations and enhance prediction accuracy.

A significant part of the course addressed the integration of side information—including contextual, user, and content-related data—into the recommendation pipeline. This enables systems to deliver more personalized and situationally relevant suggestions. One of the core technical tools introduced was the factorization machine, a powerful model capable of capturing complex interactions between diverse types of input data within a unified framework.

Through hands-on projects and theoretical modules, I gained practical skills in building robust, data-driven recommender systems that can adapt to real-world application domains, such as e-commerce, media platforms, and personalized marketing.

The Basic Recommender Systems course offered a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts, methodologies, and practical considerations involved in building intelligent recommendation engines. The program covered the foundational models—including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and knowledge-based approaches—explaining how each technique works and when it is most effective.

A key focus was learning how to select the most appropriate recommender system based on the nature of the data, user needs, and business objectives. The course also addressed how to assess system performance through targeted evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and coverage, providing a critical understanding of how to align system quality with real-world goals.

By the end of the course, I was equipped to design and implement simple yet effective recommender systems, critically analyze their strengths and limitations, and lay the groundwork for more advanced exploration in the field of intelligent personalization.

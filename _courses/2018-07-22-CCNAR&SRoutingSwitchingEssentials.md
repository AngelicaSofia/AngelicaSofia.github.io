This training provided a practical and structured look at how networks operate at a technical level. I learned how switches and routers communicate, how to configure and troubleshoot network devices, and how to manage wireless local area networks (WLANs). The course also introduced key security practices for mitigating LAN threats, which added valuable context to the risks and resilience strategies we often consider at the project level.

The content was hands-on, scenario-driven, and grounded in the challenges faced by today’s network professionals. Even without being in a technical engineering role, I found it incredibly useful to understand these dynamics when working alongside infrastructure teams or overseeing systems integration.

It’s the second course in the broader [CCNA certification](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/training-certifications/certifications/enterprise/ccna/index.html) path, and while certification wasn’t my direct goal, the knowledge gained has certainly enhanced the way I approach IT projects—from system architecture planning to security governance.

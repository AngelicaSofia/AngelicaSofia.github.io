## Y.E.S. Youth Empowering Skills for the 21st Century

[Y.E.S. – Youth Empowering Skills for the 21st Century](https://lnx.iisgadda.edu.it/?q=erasmus-2014-16) was a two-year Erasmus+ KA2 project (2014–2016) involving schools from Italy, Spain, and Sweden. It aimed to equip young people with entrepreneurial and civic skills to navigate a rapidly changing global society. The main output, HANDBOOK 1.0 – Entrepreneurship: More Than Just a Business, offers guidance and tools for students and educators to foster youth entrepreneurship. Blending text, images, and videos, the handbook promotes sustainability, social responsibility, and self-entrepreneurship, and is now distributed across European schools.

HANDBOOK 1.0 – Entrepreneurship: More Than Just a Business is the final product of the Erasmus+ KA2 project for European youth mobility titled Y.E.S. – Youth Empowering Skills for the 21st Century. This two-year collaboration (2014–2016) brought together students and teachers from three secondary schools: [High School Gadda](https://lnx.iisgadda.edu.it) (Italy), [Colegio Lope de Vega](https://lopedevega.es/en/) (Spain), and [Österåker Gymnasium](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=%C3%96ster%C3%A5ker+Gymnasium&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) (Sweden).

Now being distributed across European schools, the handbook provides students from all EU countries with guidance to develop the necessary skills to become young entrepreneurs. At the same time, it serves as a model for educators who aim to cultivate entrepreneurial attitudes among youth. Through a blend of text, images, and videos, it reflects the guiding ideas behind the project—two years of active cooperation, exchange, and best practices among the three partner schools.

I’m a determined and impact-oriented professional with a background in engineering, data science, and digital transformation. With experience across leading institutions like [Thales](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=thales&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), [Intesa Sanpaolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intesa_Sanpaolo), [CERN](https://home.cern), and [Enel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enel), I’ve managed complex projects in financial services, software migration, and AI innovation — always aiming to bridge technology with real-world value.

Currently, I serve as a Senior Project Manager at Thales, where I lead complex digital and operational transformation projects, contributing to high-visibility programs such as the *Spark Program* and the **Talent Accelerator Program (TAP 2025)**. I'm also PMP® certified and have completed advanced project management courses through the [Polimi Graduate School of Management](https://www.gsom.polimi.it), sharpening my approach to stakeholder engagement, risk management, and strategic planning.

Beyond the corporate sphere, I bring a strong human-centered mindset to my work. I have a solid background in foreign languages and international collaboration, and I’ve dedicated several years to volunteering with the [Italian Red Cross](https://cri.it), where I also served as CeFRA staff coordinator for EMT and BLSD training. I believe that leadership is not just about delivering results but about service, empathy, and empowering others.

A lifelong learner and explorer, I’m passionate about technology, finance, literature, and travel. I draw energy and inspiration from diverse experiences — whether managing high-stakes initiatives or discovering new cultures — and I strive to connect those perspectives to deliver meaningful, human-centered outcomes in everything I do.
